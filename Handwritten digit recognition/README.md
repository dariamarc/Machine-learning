#Handwritten digit recognition
***
This repository contains sample code for the classification task of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.
Two methods were used: a simple neural network, the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm and the K-means clustering. All methods were implemented using [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
